# Soil-Ecosystem-ANT-Simulator
A browser-based real-time simulation that visualizes multi-species soil ecosystems through Actor-Network Theory and graph theory. Nine biological and environmental actors interact via decomposition, predation, symbiosis, competition, and transport, producing emergent network dynamics measured with real-time ecological and graph metrics.
